# 20. Valid Parentheses

use stack data structure to perform as a LIFO

## Time and Space Complexity

```
TC: O(n)
SC: O(n)
```

#### TC is O(n):
- iterating through the string just once to check if the parentheses are valid. = O(n)

#### SC is O(n):
- using a stack to store the parentheses. = the worst case is O(n)
- using a map to store the parentheses. = O(1)

> for space complexity, fixed space is O(1).
> ğŸ‘‰ parentheses_map is fixed and its size doesn't grow with the input size.
> ğŸ‘‰ if the map has much larger size? the space complexity is still O(1).
